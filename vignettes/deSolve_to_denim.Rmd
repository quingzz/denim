## Migrate deSolve code to denim

### Original code in deSolve

The model used for demonstrating the process of migrating code from `deSolve` to `denim` is as followed

```{r}
# --- Model definition in deSolve
transition_func <- function(t, state, param){
  with(as.list( c(state, param) ), {
      dS = -beta*S*I/N
      dI1 = beta*S*I/N - rate*I1
      dI2 = rate*I1 - rate*I2
      dI =  dI1 + dI2
      dR = rate*I2
      list(c(dS, dI, dI1, dI2, dR))
  })
}

# ---- Model configuration 
parameters <- c(beta = 0.3, rate = 1/3, N = 1000) 
initialValues <- c(S = 999, I = 1, I1 = 1, I2=0, R=0)

# ---- Run simulation
times <- seq(0, 100) # simulation duration
ode_mod <- ode(y = initialValues, times = times, parms = parameters, func = transition_func)

# --- show output
ode_mod <- as.data.frame(ode_mod)
head(ode_mod[-1, c("time", "S", "I", "R")])
```

### Model definition

Unlike `deSolve` where transitions between compartments are defined by a system of ODEs, transitions in `denim` must be defined by (i) a distribution of dwell-time (either parametric or non-parametric) or (ii) a mathematical expression.

User must first identify the transitions that best describe the ones in their `deSolve` model.

```{=html}
<details>
  <summary>Identify distribution</summary>
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# --- Model definition in deSolve
transition_func <- function(t, state, param){
  with(as.list( c(state, param) ), {
      
      # For S -> I transition, since it involves parameters (beta, N), 
      # the best transition to describe this is using a mathematical formula
      dS = -beta*S*I/N
      
      # For I -> R transition, linear chain trick is applied --> implies Erlang distributed dwell time
      # Hence, we can use d_gamma from denim
      dI1 = beta*S*I/N - rate*I1
      dI2 = rate*I1 - rate*I2
      dI =  dI1 + dI2
      dR = rate*I2
      list(c(dS, dI, dI1, dI2, dR))
  })
}
```

</details>

With the transitions identified, user can then define the model in `denim`.

When using `denim`, the model structure is given as a `list` of *key*-*value* pairs where

-   *key* is a string showing the transition direction between compartments

-   *value* is the built-in distribution function that describe the transition

```{r}
# --- Transition def for denim
transitions <- list(
  "S -> I" = "beta * S * I/N * timeStep",
  "I -> R" = d_gamma(rate = 1/3, shape = 2) # shape is 2 from number of I sub compartments
)
```

Note that when converting an ODE to a math expression, we must multiply the original expression with time step duration (variable `timeStep` in the model definition code). This is because we are essentially using Euler's method to estimate the solution for the ODE.

### Model configurations

Similar to `deSolve`, `denim` also ask users to provide the [initial values]{.underline} and any [additional parameters]{.underline} in the form of named vectors.

For the example `deSolve` code, while users can use the `initalValues` from the `deSolve` code as is (`denim` will ignore unused `I1`, `I2` compartments as these sub-compartments will be automatically computed internally), it is recommended to remove redundant compartments (in this example, `I1` and `I2`).

For parameters, since `rate` is already defined in the distribution functions, users only need to keep `beta` and `N` from the initial parameters vector. We do not need to specify the value for `timeStep` variable as this is a special variable in denim and will be defined later on.

```{r}
# remove I1, I2 compartments
denim_initialValues <- c(S = 999, I = 1, R=0)
denim_parameters <- c(beta = 0.3, N = 1000) 
```

***Initialization of sub-compartments*****:** when there are multiple sub-compartments (e.g., compartment `I` consist of `I1` and `I2` sub-compartments), the initial population is always assigned to the first sub-compartment. In our example, since `I = 1`, denim will assign `I1 = 1` and `I2 = 0`.

There is also an option to distribute initial value across sub-compartments based on the specified distribution. To do this, simply set `dist_init` parameter of distribution function to `TRUE`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
transitions <- list(
  "S -> I" = "beta * S * I/N * timeStep",
  "I -> R" = d_gamma(rate = 1/3, shape = 2, dist_init = TRUE) 
)
```

However, for comparison purposes, we will keep this option `FALSE` for the remaining of this demonstration.

### Simulation

Lastly, users need to define the simulation duration and time step for `denim` to run. Unlike `deSolve` which takes a time sequence, `denim` only require the [simulation duration]{.underline} and [time step.]{.underline}

Since `denim` is a discrete time model, time step must be set to a small value for the result to closely follow that of `deSolve` (in this example, 0.01).

Note that the value for parameter `timeStep` is also the value for variable `timeStep` in the mathematical equation.

```{r}
mod <- sim(transitions = transitions,
             initialValues = denim_initialValues, 
             parameters = denim_parameters,
             simulationDuration = 100,
             timeStep = 0.01)

head(mod[mod$Time %% 1 == 0, ])
```

## Compare output

The following plots show output from `denim` and `deSolve`

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

legend(x = 15, y = 4e5,legend=c("denim", "deSolve"), col = c("#4876ff", "black"), lty=c(1,3))
